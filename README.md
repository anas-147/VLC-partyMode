# VLC-partyMode
VLC Party Mode is a lightweight tool that lets users share timestamped reactions and comments during offline movie playback using VLC Media Player. Think of it as an asynchronous watch party — where friends can experience each other’s laughter, shock, or joy at the exact same moments in a movie, even if they're watching it hours or days apart.
